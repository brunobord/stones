# stones

**stones** is a tabletop roleplaying game about hunters in prehistoric times. It uses only four-sided dice (named "stones") for its resolution mechanics.

**stones** started as a 200-word RPG, [written for the 2017 challenge](https://200wordrpg.github.io/), organised by [David Schirduan](https://technicalgrimoire.com/) and [Marshall Miller](http://www.finemessgames.com/).

Since I was quite satisfied by the [version submitted for the contest](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2017/rpg/2017/04/22/Stones.html), I felt I had to try to expand it a bit. This impression was confirmed by the review made by this [Australian blogger named Ivan](http://roleplaygreenroom.blogspot.fr/2017/05/200-word-rpg-challenge-2017-reviews_14.html). I quote:

>  Caveman roleplay with d4s. Though not an exciting system, it’s functional and does its job well. The highlight is the document’s voice, which is utterly primitive whilst still being perfectly capable of explaining everything clearly.  
Concept: Good  
System: Good  
Execution: Excellent  
Verdict: Great

This *"Great"* verdict convinced me to expand **stones** and see how I could make it more consistent and maybe a better, more complete game.
