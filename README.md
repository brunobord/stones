# stones

**stones** is a tabletop roleplaying game about hunters in prehistoric times. It uses only four-sided dice (named "stones") for its resolution mechanics.

## browse

* The [latest (v2-BETA1) of the RPG **stones**](v2/) can be found here,
* The [200-word RPG version is still visible](v1/) if you want to play it.

## (pre)history

**stones** started as a 200-word RPG, [written for the 2017 challenge](https://200wordrpg.github.io/), organised by [David Schirduan](https://technicalgrimoire.com/) and [Marshall Miller](http://www.finemessgames.com/).

Since I was quite satisfied by the [version submitted for the contest](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2017/rpg/2017/04/22/Stones.html), I felt I had to try to expand it a bit. This impression was confirmed by the review made by this [Australian blogger named Ivan](http://roleplaygreenroom.blogspot.fr/2017/05/200-word-rpg-challenge-2017-reviews_14.html). I quote:

> Caveman roleplay with d4s. Though not an exciting system, it’s functional and does its job well. The highlight is the document’s voice, which is utterly primitive whilst still being perfectly capable of explaining everything clearly.  
Concept: Good  
System: Good  
Execution: Excellent  
Verdict: Great

This *"Great"* verdict convinced me to expand **stones** and see how I could make it more consistent and maybe a better, more complete game.

## changes

Between v1 and v2, here are the major changes to the original game:

* Better styles (titles instead of bold text, various emphasis...),
* *stonemaster* role has been described,
* The group of players is now the *tribe* and has to tell its name,
* Character (*hunter*) generation is expanded. added the *young* subclass. the player may now pick one *talent*,
* *talents* are (hopefully) explained in a better way,
* New section: *things* (equipment),
* Action resolution: taking into account the fact that the character may only have one *blood* left,
* *dangers* are boosted (I did the maths, they were too easily defeated),
* *boons* section to explain how to help others,
* *heal* section expanded,
* Experience and "levelling up" mechanism added in the *grow* section,
* New rules: *trade* and *make* (craft),
* A whole new section, for *stonemasters* with advices, tools and story leads:
    * The *danger* section is moved there,
    * A *shaman* section to explain how to use shaman powers,
    * Weather generation (*sky*),
    * Land and dangers section,
    * *other tribes* section with sort of "reaction roll".
